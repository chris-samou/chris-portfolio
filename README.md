# Christos Samourelis - Personal Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio, a place to showcase my projects, skills, and professional journey. This site was built from the ground up with a strong focus on performance, modern development practices, and a clean, user-centric design.

## About This Project

The goal of this portfolio is to serve as a dynamic, engaging, and fast digital resume. It's not just a list of my work, but a demonstration of my ability to build high-quality web experiences. Every component, animation, and design choice was made deliberately to reflect the kind of work I am passionate about.
